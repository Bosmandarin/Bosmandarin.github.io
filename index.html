	<h4>The final look of this website is inspired by Jamie XX artist <a href="http://www.jamiexx.com/#">website</a>. Much love for keeping the vibe alive </h4>

	<p>The strongest point in Jamie XX's website is the interactivity. It makes the viewer a participant as opposed to a spectator in the way the website is experienced which is very effective in drawing and retaining viewers. The CSS is also well done and the use of bright lumninescent colors is like honey to bees.</p>
